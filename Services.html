            <h2 id="audio">Audio Editing</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced audio editor and I, as well as others, believe that I am very good at it. I have edited interviews, tutorials and even audio for advertisements. I have developed extraordinary listening skills and i can catch even the slightest
                odd sound in an audio file. If you listen to my latest YouTube videos you would realize that I edit out every time I take in and let out a breath. I can clean up audio to reduce some background noise(sometimes it is just best to get it
                right from the recording stage), cut out silence, coughs, breaths, repitition, mistakes etc. I am also capable of mixing vocals with music(or any audio files) as well as adding sound effects. Need me to let it sound like you are at a beach
                or at school? I am capable of doing all this. I always pay attention to detail, and i present drafts to my customers for confirmation before producing the final product. Press the "Contact Me" button below to view my contact information
                if you are interested in hiring me for audio editing services. You can also view some examples of my work by pressing the "Past Work" button below.

            <h2 id="voice">Voice Over</h2>
            <p>I always get comments on my videos along the lines of "Your voice is amazing" and "I love your voice". Hopefully you think so too and you are in need of a Voice Over Artiste. I am experienced with studying scripts and reading them with excitement,
                professionalism and vibrance. I can also do different moods and expressions in my voice. I have a young cheerful voice and I can do a little singing too. Need someone for a jingle, reporting information or any other voice over related
                jobs? You have come to the right place because I am the girl that you are looking for. And yes, I will present a draft of the work for confirmation before the final product is produced. Press the "Past Work" button below to view some of
                the work that I have done in the past. You can also press the "Contact Me" button below to view my contact information and hire me today.

                Excel. In Microsoft Access, I can create tables, relationships, queries, forms, reports, perform calculations, do field validation and so much more. Is this the service that you need? Contact me today if you need fast, accurate and detailed
                work done. And of course, I always present a draft of the work for confirmation before the final product is produced. Press the "Contact Me" button below to hire my services today.
