# Blind Way Forward
*A practical guide to coping & thriving with visual impairment*
## Introduction
We live in a highly visual world, in which we are constantly bombarded with visual information, from billboards to electronic media to simply going about your daily routine. It is therefore not surprising that the loss of vision, whether it is sudden, as in an accident, or gradual, through degenerative conditions such as glaucoma, can leave you wondering how you will cope. The Blind Way Forward is a practical guide to coping and thriving with visual impairment. It was developed to enlighten and motivate persons who have a visual impairment and are not getting sufficient information about coping with blindness.
## Problem
In Trinidad & Tobago, when a person is diagnosed with an ocular disease that may result in an irreversible blindness, the doctor may or may not refer them to a resource center (such as the Trinidad and Tobago Blind Welfare Association) to help the patient cope positively with their diagnosis. The shock of the news, together with lack of information usually causes the patient to take a longer period of adjustment which may extend between 10 months to over a decade. Worst case scenario, they could be plummeted into depression that could lead to their eventual death. Many persons diagnosed with total blindness or low vision tend to believe that what they are going through is unique to them. This is however far from the truth. This kind of mentality does not only affect the individual or their family, but indirectly, the productivity of a nation and its economy.
## Solution
The Blind Way Forward is a unique initiative to educate persons with blindness about the various technologies and associations available to them upon diagnosis. It serves as a guide for blind individuals and their families so that they can learn how to quickly and effectively adjust to blindness. Support materials take the form of a short documentary film, audio book and printed reading material. It focuses on serving several populations: 

1. adults who have recently received a diagnosis or prognosis of blindness or acute visual impairment, 
1. persons already living with vision impairment but who have been limited due to a lack of information, or who have become disillusioned, 
1. the families, friends, and employers of persons with visual impairment, and 
1. allies or other interested parties. 

## Objective
The Blind Way Forward is intended to benefit persons with visual impairments as well as the families of these persons who provide support. Our annual target is to educate at least 500 persons with visual impairment and their families who are accessing the eye care services in Trinidad and Tobago about the various assistive technologies, support services and associations available to them upon diagnosis.

The Blind Way Forward application must be developed with accessibility in mind; blind and visually impaired persons use screen readers such as JAWs, NVDA, Microsoft Narrator, Voice Over and Talkback to navigate websites and apps using their computers and mobile devices. Consequently, a key consideration for the successful development of this idea is ensuring compliance with Section 508 and WCAG 2.0-2.1 â€“ these are guidelines for document, multimedia and web accessibility. 

## Beneficiaries
We hope that the Blind Way Forward will reach many audiences, but we are focusing on: adults who have recently received a diagnosis or prognosis of blindness or acute visual impairment; persons already living with vision impairment but who have been limited due to lack of information, or who have become disillusioned; the families, friends, and employers of persons with visual impairment; and other interested persons.
